**Author: Ishaan Ghatak - Team Manager, ESP Group 46**

This repository contains the source code for each technical demonstration created by ESP Group 46 as a part of the 2nd year of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester.
The project uses the Mbed OS online compiler platform to connect to 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

The following programs, written in C++, display functionalities including PWM motor control, line sensing, and PID control algorithm:
