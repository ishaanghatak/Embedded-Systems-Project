**Author: Ishaan Ghatak - Group 46**

This repository contains the source code for each technical demonstration created for a university project developing an autonomous line-following buggy.
The project uses the Mbed OS online compiler platform to connect to 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

The following programs, written in C++, display functionalities including PWM motor control, line sensing, and PID control algorithm:
- TD1.cpp
- TD2.cpp
- TD3.cpp
- TD4.cpp
